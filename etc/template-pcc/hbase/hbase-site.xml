    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://${namenode}:${dfs.port}/apps/hbase/data</value>
    <!--<value>hdfs://${nameservices}/apps/hbase/data</value>-->
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default HBase writes
    into /tmp.  Change this configuration else all data will be lost
    on machine restart.

  <property>    
    <name>hbase.bulkload.staging.dir</name>       
    <value>/apps/hbase/staging</value>    
    <description>Directory in the default filesystem, 
    owned by the hbase user, and has permissions(-rwx--x--x, 711)

  </property> 
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
      false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode.  If
      false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together
      in the one JVM.

  The following three properties are used together to create the list of

  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>${zookeeper-server}</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>${zookeeper.client.port}</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeepers config zoo.cfg. The port at which
    the clients will connect.
